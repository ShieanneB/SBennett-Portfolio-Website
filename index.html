                <h1>
                    Introductions
                </h1>
                <p>I'm typically really bad at introductions. I guess I prefer to the good part, getting to know people by making memories. Besides, aside from my name and a few other details, everything else is bound to change anyways, right? So let's talk about the me at this moment. As a person, I enjoy trying new hobbies but some that have been the most consistent is my interest in costuming, drawing, painting, and performing. In my free time I love to draw and design things, work on costumes for cosplays, renaissance fairs, and other events, and I perform on occassion as popular animated characters for kids birthday parties or other special events. Mostly I perform as Disney princesses but recently I started performing as superheroes. I love getting to play someone new for a bit and getting to meet other creatives.
                As a professional though, I find a strong interest in app and web development and design, which is how I ended up with my last semester of school being mainly focused on exactly that resulting in this website which is the product of a class assignment. Honestly a portfolio website was long overdue, I've learned so much but documented so little which this little website will help to change.</p>

                <p>As previously mentioned, I havn't kept most of my previous course work to use as examples and the work I did during a co-op placement as a software engineer isn't anything I could keep or share so most of the work I do have to display is newer and based on my most recent courses and personal projects. </p>

                    COMP 3220 Hospital Database Management Project
                </h2>
                <p>In my previous semester, I completed a project within a group for a database course where we had to develop a hospital management system using MSSQL. Our group decided to try implementing this database into a website using Django. This was my first time working with Django and we didn't complete the GUI portion of the project however everything we did manage to complete can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/pekcus/C3150">GitHub.</a></p>
